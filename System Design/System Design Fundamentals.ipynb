    "# System Design Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "There are more in depth guides/notes out there. These are just reminders of the core principles. You should read up more in depth on topics prior to using this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Todo:\n",
    "- REST\n",
    "- Caching\n",
    "- Queues + Asynchronism\n",
    "- Security\n",
    "- RPC\n",
    "- CDNs\n",
    "- Map Reduce\n",
    "- Case Study on SpatialOS\n",
    "- Design a couple of things\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question Answer Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use cases, constraints assumptions.\n",
    "  - Who? How? How many? What inputs? How much data? How many requests per second?\n",
    "2. High level design.\n",
    "  - Sketch main components.\n",
    "3. Design core components (details).\n",
    "4. Scale\n",
    "  - LB, Horizontal scaling, caching strategies, DB optimisations\n",
    " \n",
    "## Important concepts\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Performance vs Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability problem - fast for a single user, slow under load\n",
    "- Performance problem - slow for a single user\n",
    "\n",
    "- Horizontal Scaling: More boxes\n",
    "- Vertical Scaling: More resources on a box\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latency vs Throughput\n",
    "\n",
    "- Latency - time to perform some action\n",
    "- Throughput - number of actions we can perform in a unit of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CAP Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistency: Every read gets most recent write or error.\n",
    "- Availability: Every request gets a response, no guarantee of recency.\n",
    "- Partition Tolerance: System continues despite network failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weak: Best effort. E.g. VoIP or online games.\n",
    "- Eventual: Asynchronous replication (it'll happen over time)\n",
    "- Strong: Synchronous, transactional, has to happen before anything can tick.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Availability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fail Over\n",
    "  - Active Passive (heartbeat on a master + awake a backup. Time to wake depends on standby mode - hot or cold.)\n",
    "  - Active Active (load spread between servers)\n",
    "  - Disadvantages: More hardware, complexity, risk of loss of data if active system fails before data written to passive.\n",
    "2. Replication\n",
    "  - Master/Slave - master writes, broadcasts, slaves read only.\n",
    "  - Master/Master\n",
    "  - Disadvantages: Logic needed to promote slaves; Need a load balancer for Master/Master, they are loosely consistent (violate ACID), high write latency for synchronization, sometimes need conflict resolution\n",
    "  \n",
    "### SOLID\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Responsibility\n",
    "  - Classes have one job\n",
    "- Open Closed\n",
    "  - Open to extension\n",
    "  - Closed to modification\n",
    "- Liskov Substitution:\n",
    "  - A subclass must be substitutable for its superclass\n",
    "- Interface Segregation\n",
    "  - Interfaces should be fine grained + specific\n",
    "- Dependency Inversion\n",
    "  - High level module should not depend on low level module\n",
    "  - Abstractions should not depend on details\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Load Balancers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distribute requests from clients to servers\n",
    "- Prevent requests going to unhealthy servers\n",
    "- Prevent overloading a single resource\n",
    "- Eliminates single point of failure\n",
    "- Can have multiple with fail over availability\n",
    "- SSL termination\n",
    "\n",
    "Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random\n",
    "- Least Loaded\n",
    "- Session-based\n",
    "- Round Robin\n",
    "- Layer 4 (IP, ports etc.)\n",
    "- Layer 7 (message, cookies, header)\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be a bottleneck.\n",
    "- Can be a single point of failure, having multiple increases complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reverse Proxies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Web server that centralizes internal services.\n",
    "- Better security, can obfuscate server info, blacklist IPs, limit connections per client\n",
    "- Better scalability/flexibility - clients only see reverse proxy, you can do whatever you like with servers behind the scenes.\n",
    "- SSL termination\n",
    "- Can compress server responses\n",
    "- Can serve assets statically\n",
    "- Can act as a cache\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You guessed it, single point of failure, having multiple = increased complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LBs vs RPs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load balancer -> Helpful with multiple servers\n",
    "- Reverse Proxies -> Can be helpful with just one server\n",
    "- NGINX can do both\n",
    "\n",
    "## Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational DBS are ACID:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Atomic: Every transaction is all or nothing.\n",
    "- Consistent: Any transaction takes db from one valid state to another.\n",
    "- Isolated: Executing transactions concurrently == executing transactions serially.\n",
    "- Durable: Transactions stay once they are done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed replication techniques. Make sure you brush up on advantages/disadvantages from a db perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partitioning Technique: Federation\n",
    "\n",
    "Split DBs up by *function*. I.e. instead of monolithic DB, you have 3 micro DBs that have specific roles -> less traffic + less replication lag as a result. Better cache locality, better throughput.\n",
    "BUT: DB Joins are fucked, necesary to update application logic to deduce which DB to read + write, more hardware etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partitioning Technique: Sharding\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribute data across DB shards, which form a cluster. Same advantages of federation.\n",
    "Other disadvantages, however, include lopsided data distribution, rebalancing is hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redundancy Technique: Denormalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempts to improve read performance at expense of write performance. Write redundant copies of data into multiple tables to avoid expensive DB joins. Can help in managing Federation/Sharding. \n",
    "Disadvantages include duplicated data, more complexity to keep info in sync, under heavy write load it'll go tits up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Key-value store, with no real relations.  Denormalized, joins done in application code. Follows BASE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basically available: Guarantees availability\n",
    "- Soft state: State may change over time, even without input\n",
    "- Eventual consistency: System will become consistent over a period of time if it receives no input during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL VS NOSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "Use SQL when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Structured Data\n",
    "- Strict Schema\n",
    "- Relational Data\n",
    "- Complex joins\n",
    "- Transactions\n",
    "- Clear scaling patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "Use NoSQL when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semi structured data\n",
    "- Flexible/dynamic schema\n",
    "- Non-relational data\n",
    "- No joins\n",
    "- TB or PB of data (bigtable)\n",
    "- Data intensive workload"
