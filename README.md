# Interview Preparation

Some basic interview prep for algo + system design interviews I have coming up.

Peruse at your leisure, read + believe at your own risk

### Sections:

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. System Design Principles

#### Data Structures

We visit some common data structures + their implementations in Python 3.

#### Algorithms

We explore both implementations to common algorithms + solutions to some slightly tricky algorithmic/problem solving type questions in Python 3.

#### System Design Principles

We cover the fundamentals of architecting scalable systems.
